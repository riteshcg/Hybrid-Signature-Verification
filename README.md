# Hybrid-Signature-Verification
Created a mobile application for verification of signatures (for both online and offline) using neural networks and machine learning. Preprocessing was done and used feature extraction algorithms to extract features of signatures. Train the network, feature matching was done between genuine and test signature. Finally, decision was made on the test signature whether it was forge or genuine.
